# Study-on-the-Radiative-Transfer-Models-of-the-Complex-Land-Surface

The National Undergraduate Student Innovation Plan. I did the following in the project, 

1. Conducted simulations using coupled Community Radiative Transfer (CRTM) and Microwave Radiative Transfer Models.
2. Studied and quantified the responses of satellite-obtained brightness temperature to land properties and their sensitivities.
